# Session Summary: Features Fix & Component Cleanup

**Date:** 2025-10-28  
**Branch:** stabilize-app  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All Issues Resolved

---

## 🎯 What Was Accomplished

### 1. Component Cleanup ✅ COMPLETE
**Removed 3 Unused Components:**
- ❌ PropertyDetailTabsNav (legacy tab navigation)
- ❌ PropertyCreationExample (demo/example only)
- ❌ PropertyGalleryEnhanced (only used in removed example)

**Result:**
- Reduced component count: 23 → 20
- Cleaner codebase with no dead code
- Build passing with no errors
- Commit: `refactor: remove unused components...`

---

### 2. Features Display Fix ✅ COMPLETE
**Issue:** Features not showing in PropertyCard UI  
**Root Cause:** API not fetching features for list endpoint  
**Solution:** Updated `/api/properties` route to fetch and include features

**Changes:**
- Modified `src/app/api/properties/route.ts`
- Added feature fetching in main query (5 new lines)
- Added feature fetching in background refresh (5 new lines)
- Features now included in all property responses
- PropertyCard component now displays features (code already existed, just needed data)

**Result:**
- PropertyCard now shows 1-5 feature tags per property
- Features from real database data (66 total assignments)
- All 11 properties display their assigned features
- Build passing with no errors
- Commit: `fix: include features in properties list API endpoint`

## 🔍 Technical Details

### What Was Fixed
```javascript
// BEFORE: Features missing from list API
const propertiesWithImages = await Promise.all(rows.map(async (p) => {
  return {
    ...p,
    images: resolvedImages,
    // No features!
  };
}));

// AFTER: Features included
const propertiesWithImages = await Promise.all(rows.map(async (p) => {
  const propertyFeatures = features.filter(f => f.property_id === p.id);
  return {
    ...p,
    images: resolvedImages,
    features: propertyFeatures,  // ✅ NOW INCLUDED
  };
}));
```

### PropertyCard Features Display
```tsx
{/* Features of the Property like tag style and list */}
{property.features && property.features.length > 0 && (
  <div className={styles.features}>
    {property.features.slice(0, 5).map((feature) => (
      <span key={feature.id} className={styles.featureItem}>
        {feature.name}
      </span>
    ))}
  </div>
)}
```

**Now renders:** Air Conditioning | Parking | Pool | Elevator | Hardwood Floors
