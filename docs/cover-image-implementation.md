# Cover Image Priority Implementation - Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented cover image priority across all property display components. Now, the image marked as "cover" in the property_images table will be the primary image displayed in property cards and details.

## Changes Made

### 1. PropertyCard Component (`src/components/PropertyCard.tsx`)
- **Added `getCoverImage()` function**: Specifically retrieves the cover image for property card display
- **Updated image display logic**: Uses cover image for single image display, falls back to gallery navigation for multiple images
- **Smart display behavior**: 
  - Single image: Shows cover image directly
  - Multiple images: Shows gallery navigation with cover image first
- **Fallback system**: Cover image → First uploaded image → Type-based sample image

### 2. PropertyDetailCard Component (`src/components/PropertyDetailCard.tsx`)
- **Added `getCoverImage()` function**: Same logic for detail view consistency
- **Enhanced image sorting**: Already had proper sorting, added cover image helper for future use

### 3. PropertyPopup Component (`src/components/PropertyPopup.tsx`)
- **Added `getCoverImage()` function**: Cover image priority for popup display
- **Added `getPropertyImages()` function**: Proper image array handling for gallery
- **Updated image display**: Main popup image now shows cover image
- **Updated gallery navigation**: Uses properly sorted image arrays

### 4. Property Detail Page (`src/pages/property/[id].tsx`)
- **Enhanced image handling**: Updated to prioritize cover image in meta tags and gallery
- **Cover image for social sharing**: Open Graph meta tags now use cover image

## How It Works

### Cover Image Selection Priority:
1. **Uploaded Cover Image**: Image with `is_cover = true` from property_images table
2. **First Uploaded Image**: If no cover is set, uses first image by display_order
3. **Legacy image_url**: Falls back to single image_url field if available
4. **Type-based Sample**: Final fallback to sample images based on property type

### Display Logic:
```javascript
// Example of the cover image logic
const getCoverImage = (property) => {
  if (property.images?.length > 0) {
    const coverImage = property.images.find(img => img.is_cover);
    if (coverImage) return coverImage.image_url;
    
    const sortedImages = property.images.sort((a, b) => a.display_order - b.display_order);
    return sortedImages[0].image_url;
  }
  
  return property.image_url || getTypeBasedSample(property.type);
};
```

### Gallery Navigation:
- **Multiple Images**: Shows navigation controls and image counter
- **Single Image**: Displays cover image without navigation
- **Sort Order**: Cover image first, then by display_order ascending

## Benefits

### 1. **Consistent User Experience**
- Cover image is prominently displayed across all components
- Users see the best/most representative image first
- Consistent behavior in cards, details, and popups

### 2. **Content Control**
- Sellers can choose which image represents their property best
- Cover image appears in social media sharing
- Professional presentation with intentional image selection

### 3. **Performance Optimized**
- Single image display when only cover image is needed
- Gallery navigation only appears when multiple images exist
- Efficient image loading with proper fallbacks

### 4. **Backwards Compatibility**
- Existing properties without uploaded images still work
- Legacy `image_url` field continues to function
- Graceful degradation to sample images

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. **Property with Cover Image**
- ✅ Cover image appears in property card
- ✅ Cover image appears in property details
- ✅ Cover image appears first in gallery
- ✅ Cover image used in social sharing meta tags

### 2. **Property with Multiple Images (No Cover Set)**
- ✅ First image by display_order appears as main image
- ✅ Gallery navigation works properly
- ✅ All images accessible through navigation

### 3. **Property with Legacy image_url Only**
- ✅ Legacy image displays correctly
- ✅ Falls back to single image display
- ✅ No gallery navigation appears

### 4. **Property with No Images**
- ✅ Shows appropriate sample image based on property type
- ✅ Maintains visual consistency
- ✅ No errors or broken image displays

## Implementation Files Modified

1. `src/components/PropertyCard.tsx` - Property card display
2. `src/components/PropertyDetailCard.tsx` - Property detail information
3. `src/components/PropertyPopup.tsx` - Map popup display
4. `src/pages/property/[id].tsx` - Property detail page

## Database Integration

The implementation leverages the existing `property_images` table structure:
- `is_cover` boolean field identifies the cover image
- `display_order` integer field controls gallery sequence
- Proper sorting ensures cover image appears first
- Fallback logic handles edge cases gracefully

This implementation ensures that sellers can control which image best represents their property, providing a more professional and intentional presentation across the entire platform.
