## 💻 Code Implementation

### Priority Ranking System

```typescript
// Feature priority ranking (4 most important features)
const FEATURE_PRIORITY: { [key: string]: number } = {
  // Top 4 most important (essential features)
  'parking': 1,
  'air_conditioning': 2,
  'pool': 3,
  'gym': 4,
  // Secondary features (accessible via "Show More")
  'heating': 5,
  'elevator': 6,
  'security_system': 7,
  'doorman': 8,
  'dishwasher': 9,
  'hardwood_floors': 10,
  // ... and more
};
```

### Smart Sorting Function

```typescript
// Function to get top N features sorted by priority
const getTopFeatures = (features: any[], count: number = 4): any[] => {
  return [...features]
    .sort((a, b) => getFeaturePriority(a) - getFeaturePriority(b))
    .slice(0, count);
};
```

### Features Section UI

```tsx
<div className={styles.formSection}>
  <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-between', alignItems: 'center' }}>
    <h3>✨ Important Features</h3>
    {availableFeatures.length > 4 && (
      <button
        type="button"
        className={styles.toggleFeaturesButton}
        onClick={() => setShowAllFeatures(!showAllFeatures)}
      >
        {showAllFeatures ? 'Show Less' : 'Show More'}
      </button>
    )}
  </div>
  
  <p style={{ fontSize: '0.85rem', color: '#64748b' }}>
    {showAllFeatures 
      ? 'Select any features that apply to this property' 
      : 'Top 4 essential features for your property'}
  </p>
  
  <div className={styles.featuresGrid}>
    {(showAllFeatures ? availableFeatures : getTopFeatures(availableFeatures, 4)).map((feature) => (
      <div key={feature.id} className={styles.featureCheckbox}>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          id={`feature-${feature.id}`}
          checked={selectedFeatures.includes(feature.id)}
          onChange={(e) => {
            if (e.target.checked) {
              setSelectedFeatures([...selectedFeatures, feature.id]);
            } else {
              setSelectedFeatures(selectedFeatures.filter(id => id !== feature.id));
            }
          }}
        />
        <label htmlFor={`feature-${feature.id}`}>
          <span className={styles.featureName}>{feature.name}</span>
          {feature.category && <span className={styles.featureCategory}>{feature.category}</span>}
        </label>
      </div>
    ))}
  </div>
</div>
```
