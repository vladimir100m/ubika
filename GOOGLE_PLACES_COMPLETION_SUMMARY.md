## 💻 Technical Details

### Google Places API Configuration

```typescript
const autocomplete = new google.maps.places.Autocomplete(
  addressInputRef.current,
  {
    componentRestrictions: { country: 'all' },
    types: ['address'],
    fields: ['formatted_address', 'geometry', 'address_components', 'place_id']
  }
);
```

### Address Components Extracted

```
Input: Google Places selection
  ↓
Extract: street_number + route → Full Address
Extract: locality → City
Extract: administrative_area_level_1 → State
Extract: country → Country
Extract: postal_code → Zip Code
Extract: geometry.location → Latitude & Longitude
  ↓
Output: Form data automatically populated
```

### Environment Setup

```bash
# API Key already configured in .env.local

# No additional packages needed
# No new dependencies required
# Uses browser's native Google Maps API
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### Step-by-Step Flow

```
1. User opens "Add Property" or "Edit Property" form
   └─> Location section displayed

2. User clicks address field
   └─> Google Places script loads (if not already loaded)
   └─> Autocomplete initializes on focus

3. User starts typing: "123 Main"
   └─> Google Places returns suggestions:
       • 123 Main St, New York, NY 10001
       • 123 Main Ave, Boston, MA 02101
       • 123 Main Blvd, Chicago, IL 60601

4. User clicks on suggestion
   └─> place_changed event fires
   └─> Address components extracted:
       • street_number: "123"
       • route: "Main St"
       • locality: "New York"
       • administrative_area_level_1: "NY"
       • country: "United States"
       • postal_code: "10001"
       • geometry.location: {lat: 40.7128, lng: -74.0060}
