All requested tasks completed successfully on **2025-10-28**.

---

## 📋 Tasks Completed

### 1. ✅ Check Database Schema & Relationships
**Status:** Complete

- **Schema Examined:**
  - `property_features` table: Master catalog of 37 features
  - `property_feature_assignments` table: Join table (many-to-many relationship)
  - `properties` table: Source data

- **Relationship Identified:**
  ```
  properties (1) ←→ (N) property_feature_assignments ←→ (N) property_features
  ```

- **Current State:**
  - 11 existing properties in database
  - Previously had 20 feature assignments
  - 5 initial features (parking, balcony, pool, gym, air_conditioning)

---

### 2. ✅ Explore Current Properties in Database
**Status:** Complete

Query executed to discover all properties:
```sql
SELECT p.id, p.title, p.bedrooms, p.bathrooms, p.square_meters, 
       pt.display_name, COUNT(pfa.id) as existing_features_count
FROM properties p
LEFT JOIN property_types pt ON p.property_type_id = pt.id
LEFT JOIN property_feature_assignments pfa ON p.id = pfa.property_id
GROUP BY p.id, p.title, ...
```

**Results:**
- 11 total properties found
- Property types: House, Townhouse, Studio, Apartment, Loft
- Bedroom count: 0-5 beds per property
- Bathroom count: 1-3 baths per property
- Square meters: 30-200 m²

---

### 3. ✅ Create Feature Simulation Script
**Status:** Complete

**File:** `/scripts/simulate-features.js` (260 lines)

**Features:**
1. **Step 1**: Insert 37-feature catalog into `property_features` table
2. **Step 2**: Fetch all existing properties with characteristics
3. **Step 3**: Clear old feature assignments (idempotent)
4. **Step 4**: Generate & assign features using intelligent logic
5. **Step 5**: Report statistics and distribution

**Feature Catalog (37 total):**

| Category | Count | Examples |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Interior | 13 | Air Conditioning, Heating, Washer, Dishwasher, Fireplace, Hardwood Floors, Granite Counters, etc. |
| Outdoor | 10 | Balcony, Patio, Garden, Parking, Driveway, Deck, Yard, BBQ Grill, Outdoor Kitchen, Carport |
| Amenities | 14 | Pool, Gym, Elevator, Security System, Doorman, Concierge, Rooftop, Spa, Sauna, Parking Garage, Storage, Community Center |

**Intelligent Assignment Logic:**
- Base features (all properties): Parking, Air Conditioning
- Property type-specific: Apartments get Elevator/Security; Houses get Driveway/Yard
- Size-based: 2+ bathrooms → Granite Counters; 3+ bedrooms → Fireplace
- Random variety: 1-3 random features added per property
- Duplicate prevention: No feature assigned twice to same property

### 4. ✅ Run Feature Simulation
**Status:** Complete

**Execution Command:**
```bash
npx dotenv -e .env.local -- node scripts/simulate-features.js
```

**Results:**
```
✓ Features ready (30 new features added)
✓ Found 11 properties
✓ Removed 20 old feature assignments

Processing properties:
  ✓ Mock Property #10 (House) - 7 features assigned
  ✓ Mock Property #5 (House) - 7 features assigned
  ✓ Mock Property #1 (Townhouse) - 6 features assigned

  ✓ Mock Property #6 (Studio) - 6 features assigned
  ✓ Mock Property #4 (Loft) - 3 features assigned
  ✓ Mock Property #2 (Townhouse) - 5 features assigned
  ✓ Mock Property #8 (Apartment) - 7 features assigned
  ✓ Mock Property #7 (Studio) - 4 features assigned
  ✓ Mock Property #9 (Apartment) - 7 features assigned
  ✓ test (null) - 7 features assigned

Statistics:
  Total Properties: 11
  Properties with Features: 11 (100% coverage)
  Total Feature Assignments: 66
  Unique Features Used: 21 out of 37

Distribution by Category:
  Amenities: 26 assignments
  Outdoor: 17 assignments
  Interior: 13 assignments
```
