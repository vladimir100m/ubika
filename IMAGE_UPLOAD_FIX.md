# 🖼️ Image Upload - Fixed!

## What Was Wrong
The image upload process was incomplete:
- ✅ Files were being uploaded to Vercel Blob storage
- ❌ But NOT being registered in the database (`property_images` table)
- Result: Images would upload but never appear in the UI

## What's Fixed
Now the upload process is **two-step**:

1. **Upload to Blob Storage** (`/api/blobs/upload`)
   - File sent to Vercel Blob
   - Returns blob URL

2. **Register in Database** (`/api/properties/images`)
   - Creates record in `property_images` table
   - Links image URL to property
   - Sets `is_cover`, `display_order`, etc.

## Testing the Fix

### Step 1: Go to Seller Dashboard
```
http://localhost:3000/seller
```

### Step 2: Add/Edit a Property
- Click on a property or create a new one

### Step 3: Upload an Image
- Drag & drop an image
- Or click upload button and select file

### Step 4: Check Console
You should see logs like:
```
📤 Uploading to Vercel Blob...
✅ Blob upload successful: https://...
💾 Registering image in database...
✅ Image registered in database: {...}
```

### Step 5: Verify in Database
The image should now appear:
- ✅ In the property preview
- ✅ In `property_images` table (check with script)

## Debug Commands

Check if images are in database:
```bash
node scripts/verify-properties.js
```

Clear cache if needed:
```bash
node scripts/nuke-cache.js
```

## Expected Flow

```
User selects image
    ↓
Component adds to upload queue
    ↓
Upload to Vercel Blob (/api/blobs/upload)
    ↓
Get blob URL back
    ↓
Register in database (/api/properties/images)
    ↓
Create property_images record
    ↓
Return image data to UI
    ↓
Display in property gallery
```

All steps now working! 🎉
