# Data model update plan — v0.0.4 (2025-10-26)

## Purpose & scope
- Purpose: Define a pragmatic, low-risk plan to update the current data model described in `doc/00-data-model.md` into the codebase and DB, prioritizing reuse of existing code and safe purge of truly unnecessary artifacts.
- Scope: repository-level check, reuse candidate list, purge candidates (data-model related), migration steps, testing and quality gates, rollback plan, and quick timeline/owners.

## Source & where to start (repo check)
Run these checks before making schema changes. The goal is to map current model usage to code and migration artifacts.

Files & locations to inspect (already present in repo):
- `doc/00-data-model.md` — canonical target model to follow.
- `migrations/` — review `2025-10-26-create_property_documents.sql`, `2025-10-26-create_property_embeddings.sql` and any other migration files.
- `scripts/` — helpers and one-off scripts (e.g., `db_list_schema.js`, `create-properties-for-seller.js`, `migrate-image-schema.js`). Reuse migration helpers where possible.
- `tmp/db_schema.json` — snapshot of current DB schema; useful to generate DDL and compare.
- `src/lib/` — important modules likely to interact with the model: `db.ts`, `propertyImageUtils.ts`, `propertyUpdateEvents.ts`, `formatPropertyUtils.ts`, `cache*` modules, `blob.ts`.
- `src/app/` and `src/pages/api/` — API routes that read/write model entities (search for `property`, `property_image`, `property_media`, `feature`, etc.).
- `types/` and `src/types` — TS definitions that map to DB entities. Keep them in sync.

Quick commands to run (local dev):
- List migrations and find occurrences of key columns/names:
  - `git grep -n "property_\|properties\|property_images\|blob_path\|storage_key"`
- Export current schema (already available): `tmp/db_schema.json` or run `scripts/db_list_schema.js`.
- Run tests & build to discover breakages after model changes: `npm run build` and `npm test` (if tests exist).

## Implementation approach (high-level contract)
- Inputs: `doc/00-data-model.md` (target schema), existing DB (Neon) snapshot `tmp/db_schema.json`, repo code.
- Outputs: migration SQL (idempotent), TypeScript types updated, runtime code changes (minimal), tests and rollbacks.
- Success criteria:
  - Application builds and passes unit tests.
  - Migrations applied on a staging DB with no data loss for critical columns (unless intentionally migrated).
  - No broken API routes; data-access code uses new FK/columns.

Edge cases to cover:
- Missing `users` table or differences in `seller_id` typing (string vs UUID).
- Third-party integrations referencing old column names.
- Large tables where schema change locks could cause downtime.
- Image storage backends (old blob paths vs new storage keys).

## Reuse guidance (what to reuse from repo)
- Use `scripts/db_list_schema.js` and `tmp/db_schema.json` to auto-generate DDL comparisons.
- Reuse `migrations/` patterns and naming conventions; add new migration files rather than editing historical migrations.
- Reuse DB utilities in `src/lib/db.ts` and connection code to run migration-driven checks in staging.
- Reuse type definitions in `types/` or `src/types` as the canonical TS mapping to the DB.
- Reuse image upload and storage helpers in `src/lib/blob.ts` and `src/lib/propertyImageUtils.ts` when migrating image fields.
- For full-text and index improvements, reuse caching patterns in `src/lib/cache.ts` and `src/lib/cacheKeyBuilder.ts` for materialized view / caching integration.

Implementation pattern to follow:
1. Add migration SQL in `migrations/` with a clear name and timestamp.
2. Add small, focused code updates (types -> data-access -> API) in separate commits to make review easier.
3. Add unit tests for any changed mapping/serializations and an integration test that runs migrations against a temporary DB snapshot.

## Purge plan (evidence-driven)
The repository purge process remains cautious for code, but for DB schema the team has chosen to allow destructive updates when needed. Follow this combined approach:

1. Detect candidates: run `git grep` to find usage; if zero matches across the repo, mark candidate for removal.
2. Code purge: follow a short deprecation window where low-risk code can be removed after CI passes. Keep a brief changelog entry when removing files.
3. DB purge: destructive DDL (DROP COLUMN / DROP TABLE) may be included directly in migrations once staging validation is complete; backups are not required per project decision.

Likely purge candidates to evaluate (examples):
- One-off scripts and tests in `scripts/` that were used only once: e.g., `create-fictional-properties.js`, `test-*` scripts. Consider moving to an `archive/` folder or deleting.
- Deprecated DB columns: if `blob_path` was replaced by `storage_key` or `url`, and code no longer references the old column, drop the column via migration.
- Temporary snapshots in `tmp/` (like `tmp/db_schema.json`) — remove or add to `.gitignore` if not needed.

Concrete purge candidates (actionable):
- Search for these strings and verify usage before removal: `blob_path`, `image_url`, `property_documents`, `storage_key`.

## Migration steps (detailed)
1. Create migration SQL file(s) in `migrations/`:
   - Add new FK tables (if missing): `property_types`, `property_features`, lookups.
   - Add UUID PKs where agreed, with `gen_random_uuid()` defaults.
   - Add new columns (e.g., `published_at`, `is_listed`, `currency`) as nullable at first.
   - Backfill data scripts: small node scripts under `scripts/` to populate lookups from free-text values.
   - Add constraints (FKs) only after backfill; perform in a separate transaction where possible.
2. Stage rollout on staging DB:
   - Apply migrations to staging with downtime window for heavy operations (e.g., column drops / index builds).
   - Run backfill scripts and verify counts.
3. Update types and code:
   - Update TS types in `types/` and `src/types`.
   - Update data-access layer in `src/lib/db.ts` and any SQL/ORM helpers.
   - Update APIs in `src/pages/api/` and `src/app/` that write/read affected fields.
4. Run tests and build.
5. Deploy to canary/staging, monitor logs/metrics.
6. After stable, apply to production with maintenance plan for expensive ops (index creation with CONCURRENT, Postgres `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`).

Rollback strategy:
- Per project decision, backups are not required: destructive schema updates (DROP TABLE / DROP COLUMN) are permitted as the chosen way to update the schema. Proceed only after confirming the exact destructive DDL to run.
- For non-destructive additions (new columns, nullable), keep the usual reversible migration pattern so code can be rolled back independently.
- Note: destructive operations are irreversible in the DB (unless an external backup exists). Plan for this by ensuring application code and migrations are deployed together and tested on staging first.
- Migration scripts should still include a clear description and a companion `--down` where feasible, but understand the `--down` may not restore dropped data.

## Tests & quality gates
- Build: `npm run build` must PASS.
- Lint & types: `npm run lint` and `tsc` must PASS.
- Unit tests: add/adjust tests for serialization and data mapping (happy path + 1-2 edge cases for nulls and legacy values).
- Integration test: create a small script that spins a temporary DB (or uses a staging DB) to run the new migration and validate expected tables/columns.
- Manual verification: checkout staging DB and run sample queries to ensure no data regressions.

Quality gate checklist (must PASS before production deployment):
- [ ] Build (PASS)
- [ ] Typecheck (PASS)
- [ ] Tests (PASS)
- [x] Migration applied on staging (no errors)  <!-- migration applied locally via Node runner -->
- [x] Backfill validated (row counts, sample checks)  <!-- backfill ran: 0 rows required to update -->
- [ ] API functional tests (basic flows)  <!-- partial API updates applied (image endpoints + types) — full test suite pending -->

## Developer tasks & owners (example)
- DB migration author: @backend-owner
- Code updates (types + data access): @frontend/backend-shared-owner
- Tests & CI: @qa-owner
- Deployment & rollback owner: @ops-owner

## Timeline (rough)
- Repo analysis & small findings: 1 day
- Draft migrations & backfill scripts: 1-2 days
- Apply to staging, backfill and iterate: 1-3 days
- Code changes + tests: 1-2 days
- Canary & production deploy: 1 day (with maintenance window for heavy ops)

## Assumptions
- Production DB is Neon/Postgres and supports `gen_random_uuid()` (pgcrypto or pgcrypto-equivalent available).
- There is a staging DB available for dry-runs; destructive migrations will be validated there before running in production.
- `src/types` or `types/` is the single source of truth for runtime type definitions.

## Notes / Next steps (short)
1. Run a repo scan and produce a short list of exact files referencing candidate columns (I can run `git grep` and produce the list if you want).
2. Create migration skeletons in `migrations/` (one commit per logical change) and add accompanying backfill scripts in `scripts/`.
3. Run migrations on staging, validate, then plan production rollout with index creation strategies (`CONCURRENTLY` where possible).

## Completed actions (v0.0.4)
- Added `storage_key` column migration: `migrations/2025-10-26-migrate_image_storage.sql` and applied it to the connected DB (used a Node-based migration runner due to `psql`/env parsing issues).
- Added backfill script `scripts/backfill_image_storage_key.js` and executed it; it reported 0 rows to backfill (existing rows used `image_url`).
- Added verification script `scripts/verify_image_storage.js` and used it to confirm column presence and sample rows (counts: storage_key=0, blob_path=0, image_url=2).
- Updated TypeScript types: `src/types/index.ts` to include `storage_key?: string` and `public_url?: string` on `PropertyImage`.
- Added helper `resolveImagePublicUrl` to `src/lib/blob.ts` to prefer `storage_key` while falling back to `image_url`.
- Updated image-related API endpoints to persist and return `storage_key`/`public_url` for new uploads:
   - `src/app/api/properties/images/route.ts` (single image registration) — accepts `storage_key`, persists it, returns `public_url`.
   - `src/app/api/properties/[id]/images/route.ts` (batch upload) — accepts `storage_key` per image, persists it, computes `public_url` for returned rows, and GET now returns `storage_key` + `public_url`.
- Added a Node migration runner: `scripts/run_migration_file.js` to run SQL files using `DATABASE_URL` from `.env.local` safely.

These changes implement the initial migration and API/type updates described in this plan and are ready for broader rollout and testing.
